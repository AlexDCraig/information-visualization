\section{Introduction}
The following subsections explain what the problem is we hope to elucidate through the use of information visualization, the importance of visualization as a tool in understanding the problem, potential users of our visualizations, and how we plan on approaching our visualizations in subsequent assignments.

\subsection{Problem Explanation}
In the National Basketball Association (NBA), teams are allowed 15 players on their rosters and each player is paid a salary established in their contract. Each team can spend a total of ***x dollars*** on their players, and this is referred to as their \emph{salary cap}.
